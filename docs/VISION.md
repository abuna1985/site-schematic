# SiteSchematic: Overall Project Vision

## 1. Core Purpose
SiteSchematic is a high-leverage technical diagnostic tool designed specifically for Senior Software Engineers to demonstrate their value to agency leadership. It "X-rays" any website to visualize the "Bridge" between legacy systems (PHP/WordPress) and modern architectures (React/Next.js).

## 2. Target Audience
**Primary:** Directors of Technology, CTOs, and Engineering Managers at mid-sized digital agencies (51-200 employees).
**Secondary:** Clients of those agencies who need "Visual Proof" of why a technical refactor is necessary.

## 3. The "Force Multiplier" Value Proposition
- **For the Agency:** It’s a sales weapon. It helps them win refactor projects by visually proving technical debt.
- **For You (Adam):** It proves you are an Architect, not just a "coder." It demonstrates your 6 years of experience (Agency Dev + Mentor) through high-end visualization and insightful diagnostic notes.

## 4. Visual Vibe: "The Technical Blueprint"
- **Style:** A "Live Schematic" that looks like a high-end engineering drawing.
- **Background:** Subtle CSS-based grid paper.
- **Motion:** GSAP-driven "sketching" and "line-drawing" animations when results are revealed.
- **Colors:** Deep Blueprint Blue (#002B5B), Neon Cyan for modern tech, and Warning Red for tech debt.

## 5. Technical Architecture (Separation of Concerns)
- **The Engine (Server):** Next.js Server Actions using Cheerio to scrape and parse site headers/DOM.
- **The Data Contract:** A standardized JSON schema that bridges the Scraper and the UI.
- **The UI (Client):** React components styled with CSS Modules and animated with GSAP.
- **Sharing:** $0 Database-less sharing using Base64 URL encoding.

## 6. Project Goal
To move from inception to a live, shareable Vercel deployment in 3 days, providing a "Forever Project" that can be expanded with more advanced diagnostic logic over time.
