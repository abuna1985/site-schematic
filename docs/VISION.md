# SiteSchematic: Project Vision

## 1. Core Purpose
SiteSchematic is a lead-generation diagnostic tool for digital agencies. It "X-rays" legacy websites to visualize the structural liabilities of monolithic systems (WordPress/CMS) and heavy JavaScript architectures (React/Next.js), providing a "Blueprint for Transition" to high-performance Astro/Headless environments.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Digital Agencies:** A sales weapon to visually prove technical debt and win high-ticket refactor projects.
- **CTOs & Tech Leaders:** Engineering managers who need data-driven justification for modernizing their stack.

## 3. The "Lead-Gen" Value Proposition
- **Visual Proof:** Transforms abstract technical debt into a tangible engineering schematic.
- **Conversion Focused:** Bridges the gap between "it works" and "it's a liability" by highlighting specific business risks.
- **WP-to-Astro Focus:** Specifically optimized to show why WordPress sites are a security and performance burden.

## 4. Visual Vibe: "The Technical Blueprint"
- **Style:** A "Live Schematic" that looks like a high-end engineering drawing.
- **Background:** Subtle CSS-based grid paper.
- **Motion:** GSAP-driven "sketching" and "line-drawing" animations.
- **Complexity Heatmap:** Legcy sites show "tangled" lines to visually represent technical debt, while modern sites show clean, orthogonal lines.

## 5. Technical Architecture
- **Diagnostic Engine:** A lightweight service that fingerpints site architectures and calculates stress factors.
- **The Data Contract:** A standardized JSON schema (Zod) that bridges the Diagnostic Engine and the UI.
- **Humble UI:** Pure presentational React components that "listen" to props.
- **Performance:** Optimized for zero impact on TBT, ensuring the tool itself is a model of high-performance code.
